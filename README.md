Selecting a shape type from the top menu allow you to trigger the drawing mode.
You can then draw shapes by first clicking on the canvas and then moving the mouse to plot the shape.

You can change the color of the line using the "Changer" button.
You can also click on "Remplir la forme" to fill the last shape drawn with the current color.
*Note : You can fill a shape with a different color than its contour*

#### Line style
You can switch between to a dashed line selecting "Pointill√©"

##### Line thickness
You can change the line thickness using the slider

##### Erasing
You can erase the last shape drawn or even erase all shapes using "Annuler" and "Tout effacer" buttons

#### Resizing mode
When you switch to resizing mode you can select a shape by clicking on it (even for non-filled shapes).
Once a shape is selected you can resize it using the small squares in the corner of the shape's bouding box by clicking on those blue squares and moving your mouse.

#### Moving mode
When you switch to resizing mode you can select a shape by clicking on it (even for non-filled shapes).
You then drag the shape by keeping your mouse down while moving and it moves.
